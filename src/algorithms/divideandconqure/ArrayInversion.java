/*
A program to find Inversion count of an array. Use D&Q (DAC).
Given an array , find the total number of inversion of it. If (i < j) and (A[i] > A[j]), then pair (i,j) is called an inversion  of an array A
For example,
Input:  A[] = [1, 9, 6, 4, 5]
Output: The inversion count is 5
There are 5 inversions in the array: (9, 6), (9, 4), (9, 5), (6, 4), (6, 5)
